  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. An efficient algorithm has a lower time complexity and performs faster as input size grows.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to its input size. It is often expressed in terms like O(n), which represents linear space usage.
